## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Setup}
library(tidyr)
library(simstudy)
```


```{r Generate Data, echo=FALSE}
##Define the "True" underlying longitudinal dataset for hippocampal volume that you will sample from with measurement error later on
###Generate data with 3 time points of hipp vol measurement at at 45, 52 and 59
###Mean and variance comes from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2019.101904

###Set up sampling parameters
nSubs<-1000
nTimepoints<-3
brainVar_mean<-4000
brainVar_sd<-420

##Generate data in wide then melt later into long
data<-tibble(
  ID = rep(1:nSubs,each=nTimepoints),
  Phase = rep(1:nTimepoints,nSubs),
  BrainVar=
)
rnorm(1000,4000,420)

tdef <- defData(varname = "Y0", dist = "normal", formula = 4000, variance = 420^2)
tdef <- defData(tdef, varname = "decRate", formula = .01, variance = .000008)
tdef <- defData(tdef, varname = "Y1", dist = "nonrandom", formula = "Y0*(1-decRate)^7")
tdef <- defData(tdef, varname = "Y2", dist = "nonrandom", formula = "Y0*(1-decRate)^14")

set.seed(483726)

dtTrial <- genData(1000, tdef)
dtTime <- addPeriods(dtTrial, nPeriods = 3, idvars = "id", timevars = c("Y0", "Y1",
    "Y2"), timevarName = "Y")
summary(dtTrial$decRate)
dtTrial

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
